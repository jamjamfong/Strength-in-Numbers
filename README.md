WARRIORS SEASON ANALYSIS

This project uses the NBA API to gather live data on the Golden State Warriors' (poor) performance for the 2024-2025 season. It includes data processing, visualization, and analysis aimed at identifying team weaknesses and optimizing future strategies. 

GETTING STARTED 

I followed the instructions on this github repository to access nba_api and use real-time data.
